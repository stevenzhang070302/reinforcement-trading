# RL Trading Bot Roadmap

This roadmap outlines phases for deploying the reinforcement learning trading bot to production.

## Phase 1: Reinforcement Learning Enhancements
1. **Fine-tune the reward function** to better capture risk-adjusted returns and trading costs.
2. **Experiment with additional RL models**, including SAC, TD3, Rainbow DQN, GRPO, and SRPO, comparing performance against the current PPO baseline.
3. **Perform hyperparameter tuning** with tools like Optuna or Ray Tune to systematically search for improved configurations.

## Phase 2: Data Pipeline and Continuous Training
1. **Establish a real-time data feed** from the broker or MCP servers, ensuring compatibility with the trading environment.
2. **Implement online learning** so the model updates as new data arrives, using Bayesian priors when appropriate.
3. **Create monitoring dashboards** to visualize trades, portfolio metrics, and training progress.

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Infrastructure
1. **Design a multi-agent framework** allowing specialized agents to trade different strategies or markets.
2. **Provide agent-to-agent communication** through a lightweight messaging layer or microservice architecture.
3. **Leverage MCP infrastructure** to scale agents across servers for higher throughput.

## Phase 4: Deployment, Risk Management, and Execution
1. **Containerize services** (training, data ingestion, execution) using Docker for reproducibility.
2. **Build a CI/CD pipeline** to automatically train, evaluate, and deploy new models with rollback capabilities.
3. **Integrate risk controls** and thorough backtesting before live execution to ensure robustness.

This phased approach helps prioritize work while steadily moving the RL trading bot toward a production-ready state.
